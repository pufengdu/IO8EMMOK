IO8EMMOK.SYS

-------------------------------------
IO8EMMOK is a driver for MS-DOS 8.00. It only works for this special version.
It has only one purpose. Allow MS-DOS 8.00 to load EMM386.EXE as normal.

DO NOT TRY TO USE IT FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE.

This driver cannot help in starting Win3xx in 386 enhanced mode.

It is implemented in a very quick and dirty way. A lot of codes were borrowed
from the HIMEMX.EXE source codes.

THIS DRIVER MUST BE THE FIRST TO LOAD IN YOUR CONFIG.SYS

Put this driver in your DOS directory. e.g. C:\DOS.

Add the following line as the FIRST LINE in your config.sys

DEVICE=C:\DOS\IO8EMMOK.SYS

Followed by:
...
...
DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM ALTBOOT

Reboot your system.

Note: The ALTBOOT parameter of EMM386.EXE is a MUST. The other paramters can
be changed. There is no paramter to IO8EMMOK.SYS

Tech notes
-------------------------------------
IO8EMMOK only RE-Hooks int 15h AH=87H/88H and AX=E801H

The hang of EMM386.EXE when loading in the config.sys of MS-DOS 8.00 is caused
by the built-in XMS driver. That driver hooked BIOS int 15H AH=87H to hang the
system. This is BY DESIGN of the MS-DOS 8.00. Because MS-DOS 8.00 has a built-
in XMS driver, which will be activated and moved to HMA along with DOS kernel
services before the processing of CONFIG.SYS, any driver attempt to turn off
A20 or release HMA will destroy the XMS driver and DOS kernel services. As MS-
DOS 8.00 is designed particularly to boot Windows ME, its only mission is to
allow the loading of all VxDs and let the system entering protected mode, where
Windows kernel will take over the control. However, real-mode patches for MS-
DOS 8.00 has been released by hackers for many years. To recover real mode of
MS-DOS 8.00, this design must be fixed. Patches for fixing this has already been
released recently. This driver is NOT the patch. It only allows you to load
EMM386.EXE without the patch. This is useful if your problem is not runnning
Win3xx in 386 mode, but simply needing EMM386.EXE. If you want to run Win3xx
in 386 mode, search and use the patch to disable the MS-DOS 8.00 built-in XMS
driver.
