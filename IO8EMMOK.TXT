IO8EMMOK - A supplemental driver for MS-DOS 8.00 (a.k.a
Windows ME Real-Mode DOS)

Version 1.3

Introduction:

IO8EMMOK provides  a set  of tools and drivers that allow
you to load Windows 3.xx in  Enhanced Mode in MS-DOS 8.00
real mode.   This was thought to  be impossible before we
have IO8EMMOK.   Most  of the  reports online  found that
MS-DOS 8.00   can   only   start Windows 3.xx in Standard
Mode, but  not in  Enhanced Mode.  This is because MS-DOS
8.00 refuses  to load EMM386.EXE normally by default. The
system will  hang if  EMM386.EXE is  loaded  directly  in
CONFIG.SYS, even  after the  Real Mode DOS patch has been
applied.  (As   MS-DOS  8.00  has  built-in  XMS  driver,
HIMEM.SYS is  no longer  needed here.)  However,  Windows
3.xx relies  on GEMMIS API to take over the system memory
management, which  is provided solely by EMM386.EXE. (You
may try  QEMM386 /  386Max. They  claim to provide GEMMIS
API. But,  neither will work.) IO8EMMOK driver  fixes the
bug that  hangs the system in loading EMM386.EXE. It also
adapts the  built-in XMS  driver for  Windows 3.xx. It is
packed with  an in-memory patch for MS-DOS 8.00 kernel to
work around  various checks  in loading Windows 3.xx (In-
memory version  W3XStart patch).  The Windows 3.xx can be
loaded after properly loading IO8EMMOK driver and the in-
memory patch  program.  Please  note  that  Windows  3.xx
WIN386.EXE still needs to be patched if your installation
is on  a  FAT32  partition.  IO8EMMOK  document  provides
instructions on  how to patch Windows For Workgroups 3.11
WIN386.EXE. This  may not  apply  to  other  versions  of
Windows 3.xx.  You will  need to  find your  own patch or
adapt the  patching instructions  for your own version of
WIN386.EXE.

Package contents:

IO8EMMOK.SYS   The driver;
IO8EMMOK.TXT   This document;
IO8EMMOK.ASM   The source code of the driver;
IO8EMMOK.BAT   Compile script for the driver;
W3XSTART.COM   In-memory patch to start Windows 3.xx;
W3XSTART.C     The source code of the W3XTART.COM;
W3XSTART.BAT   Compile script for the W3XSTART.C.

Installation:

1. Put  the IO8EMMOK.SYS  and W3XSTART.COM  in  your  DOS
directory.

2. Load  the IO8EMMOK.SYS  as the  first device driver in
your CONFIG.SYS.

     DEVICE=C:\DOS\IO8EMMOK.SYS

3.  Load   EMM386.EXE  after  the  above  line.  Use  any
parameters as you wish.

4. Add  the following  in your  AUTOEXEC.BAT, better  the
last line.

     C:\DOS\W3XSTART.EXE

5. Update mouse driver to Microsoft Mouse Driver 9.01

6. Reboot your system.

7. Start Windows 3.xx in enhanced mode.

If this  does not work, pleae report bugs on github, with
a comprehensive  copy of your CONFIG.SYS / AUTOEXEC.BAT /
MSDOS.SYS and  screenshots that  can help  reproduce  the
bug.

Conditions:

1. This  must be  done AFTER  you can boot into real-mode
MS-DOS 8.00.

2. Your  computer MUST use the Normal / KBC / 8042 way of
A20 gate  control, not  the fast  /  BIOS  way.  Because,
currently, IO8EMMOK  only includes  KBC A20  gate control
methods. Other methods may be added in future versions.

3. You  can start  your Windows  3.xx  in  standard  mode
before using this driver.
